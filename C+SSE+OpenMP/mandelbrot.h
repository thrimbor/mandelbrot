/*
 * Generates an image of a Mandelbrot set in the given bounded complex plane
 * for a given sampling specified in width times height pixels. Uses colormapping
 * to determine the pixel's color from its iteration return value.
 * 
 * Arguments:
 *	upperLeft - Upper left corner of the complex plane for calculation
 *	lowerRight - Lower right corner of the complex plane for calculation
 *	maxIterations - Maximum number of iterations that are executed to determine a series' boundedness
 *	width - Width of the resulting image in pixels (also defines horizontal sampling density)
 *	height - Height of the resulting image in pixels (also defines the vertical sampling density)
 *
 * Returns:
 *   An array of RGB 8-bit values (unsigned char) representing the color-mapped
 *   Mandelbrot set. Pixels are saved in row-major order.
